this will be the web frontend for my photo site, which consumes the output of
the backend.

I am setting this all up from scratch to get a better understanding of the
javascript/typescript/react ecosystem from the perspective of a backend dev, and
with the goal of having as few separate config files as possible (python does it
with pyproject.toml, so why not javascript??)

I don't think these are best practices but I am forging ahead regardless.
